2. Put the downloaded file into your mods folder which can be found inside your Minecraft instance folder. Create it if it's not present.
3. Done! You can launch the game.

## 🗄️▪ Server
1. Same as for the client. The file can be used on both clients and servers.
2. In your server folder, find the mods folder and put the downloaded file there. It is recommended that the server was launched at least once before.
3. Done! You can launch the server.
